The “UNAUDITED UNCERTIFIED MUTUAL FUND HOLDINGS” LIST (“the list”) IS TO BE USED FOR REPORTING PURPOSES ONLY.
The list is submitted for the general information of the Fund. The list has been created from the books and records of the Fund without examination by independent auditors.
The uncertified holdings list is available on a one business day lag. The figures shown in the “Value” column, represent the values of the Fund’s investments using the
amortized cost method of valuation pursuant to Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The list is subject to change without notice. The Value
represents the Gross Assets of the Fund and may include forward settling trades.
This list is for informational purposes only and not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any security.
Each business day, each Fund will make available upon request an uncertified complete schedule of its portfolio holdings as of the prior business day.
Shareholders may request portfolio holdings schedules for a particular day or on an ongoing basis at no charge by calling 1-800-480-4111.
Unless otherwise noted, the dollar-weighted average maturity and the dollar-weighted average life listed for the Fund is the same for each of the Fund's share classes
Dollar-weighted average maturity: The average maturity of the Fund is the average amount of time until the organizations that issued the debt securities in the Fund's
portfolio must pay off the principal amount of the debt. "Dollar-weighted" means the larger the dollar value of debt security in the Fund, the more weight it gets in
calculating this average. To calculate the dollar-weighted average maturity, the Fund may treat a variable or floating rate security as having a maturity equal to the time
remaining to the security's next interest rate reset8 date rather than the security's actual maturity date.
Dollar-weighted average life: The dollar weighted average portfolio maturity without reference to the exceptions used for variable or floating rate securities regarding
the use of the date of interest rate resets in lieu of the security's actual maturity date.
Final Legal Maturity Date: The final legal maturity date is the date on which the organization that issued the debt security must pay off the principal amount of the debt.
